# 2685. Count the Number of Complete Components

You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n vertices, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting vertices ai and bi.

Return the number of complete connected components of the graph.

A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be complete if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.
Example 2:



Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 50
0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
ai != bi
There are no repeated edges.

This Python code is solving the **"Number of Complete Components"** problem on LeetCode using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.

## **Understanding the Problem**
- You have an **undirected graph** with `n` nodes labeled `0` to `n-1`.
- You are given a list of **edges**, where each edge connects two nodes.
- A **component** of the graph is **complete** if **every node is connected to every other node in that component**.
- You need to **count** the number of complete components in the given graph.

## **Code Breakdown**

### **1️⃣ Graph Representation**
The graph is stored as an **adjacency list** using a dictionary:
```python
g = defaultdict(list)
for a, b in edges:
    g[a].append(b)
    g[b].append(a)
```
Here:
- `g[a].append(b)` means `b` is a neighbor of `a`.
- `g[b].append(a)` means `a` is a neighbor of `b` (since it's an **undirected** graph).
- This helps us **efficiently** find neighbors of a node.

---

### **2️⃣ DFS Traversal**
The **DFS function** explores all nodes in a component and returns:
- **`x`** → Total number of nodes in the component.
- **`y`** → Total number of edges in the component.
  
```python
def dfs(i: int) -> (int, int):
    vis[i] = True  # Mark node as visited
    x, y = 1, len(g[i])  # x = 1 (current node), y = its edges
    for j in g[i]:  # Iterate through neighbors
        if not vis[j]:  # If neighbor is not visited
            a, b = dfs(j)  # Recursively visit the neighbor
            x += a  # Add nodes count
            y += b  # Add edges count
    return x, y  # Return total nodes and edges in the component
```

---

### **3️⃣ Checking for Complete Components**
Once we traverse a component, we check if it is **complete**:
```python
ans += a * (a - 1) == b
```
- A **complete graph** with `a` nodes must have exactly **`a * (a - 1)` edges (divided by 2)**.
- However, because edges are **counted twice** (once for each node), we check `a * (a - 1) == b`.

---

### **4️⃣ Main Function Execution**
```python
vis = [False] * n  # Visited array to track nodes
ans = 0  # Count of complete components

for i in range(n):  # Iterate through all nodes
    if not vis[i]:  # If node is not visited
        a, b = dfs(i)  # Run DFS to get component size and edges
        ans += a * (a - 1) == b  # Check if component is complete

return ans  # Return total number of complete components
```

---

## **Example Walkthrough**
### **Input**
```python
n = 6
edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [1,2], [3,4], [4,5], [3,5]]
```
**Graph Representation**  
```
  0---1
   \  |
    \ |
     2       3---4
             |  /
             5
```
Here, we have **two components**:
1. **(0, 1, 2) → Complete graph** (3 nodes, 3 edges).
2. **(3, 4, 5) → Complete graph** (3 nodes, 3 edges).

### **DFS Execution**
- Start DFS from `0` → Finds `{0, 1, 2}` (3 nodes, 3 edges).
- Start DFS from `3` → Finds `{3, 4, 5}` (3 nodes, 3 edges).

### **Final Answer**
Both components are complete, so **output = `2`**.

---

## **🔹 Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Building the graph** takes **O(E)** (where `E` is the number of edges).
- **DFS traversal** visits each node and edge **once**, so **O(N + E)**.
- Overall, the **time complexity is O(N + E)**, which is efficient for large graphs.

---

## **✨ Summary**
✅ **Uses DFS** to explore connected components.  
✅ **Counts edges and nodes** to check if a component is **complete**.  
✅ **Efficient** with **O(N + E)** time complexity.  
✅ **Works for both sparse and dense graphs**.
